# Monitoring & Observability Stack

This repository contains a **general-purpose monitoring and observability setup** designed to provide visibility into system performance, resource usage, and application behavior.

The stack focuses on **metrics collection, visualization, and operational insight** using
Prometheus for metrics collection and
Grafana for visualization.

---

## Overview

This setup provides a centralized view of system and application metrics, enabling teams to track performance, resource utilization, and runtime behavior over time.

By aggregating metrics into a single observability layer, it becomes easier to correlate infrastructure signals with application-level activity and identify abnormal patterns before they impact system stability.

---

## Architecture

At a high level, the stack is composed of:

* **Metrics Producers**
  System components and applications expose runtime metrics (CPU, memory, JVM, message counts, errors, etc.).

* **Prometheus**
  Scrapes metrics at regular intervals and stores them as time-series data.

* **Grafana**
  Queries Prometheus and presents metrics through dashboards for real-time and historical analysis.

---

## Dashboard Overview

The provided dashboard offers a unified operational view, including:

### System Metrics

* CPU usage per instance
* Memory consumption (including JVM memory)
* Garbage Collection activity

### Application Metrics

* Message throughput (rate per second)
* Total number of messages produced
* Error rates (e.g. JSON parsing errors)
* Connection status indicators (e.g. WebSocket connectivity)

This combination allows correlating **resource usage** with **application behavior**.
